    "### Why use SOLID principles?\n",
    "Let’s look at the possible issues below that may occur in the code if we don’t adhere to the SOLID principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code may become tightly coupled with several components, which makes it difficult to integrate new features or bug fixes and sometimes leads to unidentified problems.\n",
    "- The code will be untestable, which effectively means that every change will need end-to-end testing.\n",
    "- The code may have a lot of duplication.\n",
    "- Fixing one issue results in additional errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we adhere to the SOLID principles, we are able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce the tight coupling of the code, which reduces errors.\n",
    "- Reduce the code’s complexity for future use.\n",
    "- Produce more extensible, maintainable, and understandable software code.\n",
    "- Produce the code that is modular, feature specific, and is extremely testable."

    "Let’s look at the definition of the five design principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system.\n",
    "- In the **Open Closed principle (OCP)**, software components should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "- In the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.\n",
    "- The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** makes fine-grained interfaces that are client specific.\n",
    "- The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**, ensures that the high-level modules are not dependent on low-level modules. In other words, one should depend upon abstraction and not concretion.\n"
